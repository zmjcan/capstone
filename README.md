# Capstone Proposal

### Author: Maggie Mengjiao Zhang

## Overview

### Statement

**TailFinder** is an exciting new platform that helps reunite lost pets with their families. Let's bring those furry friends back where they belong!

### Problem

Losing a pet is a distressing experience. Pets cannot communicate their location, and microchips do not provide real-time tracking. Access to microchip data is restricted to shelters and authorized personnel, leaving pet owners anxious and powerless.

With **TailFinder**, we make finding lost pets easier through social posting and map pinning features. Imagine the relief and joy of reuniting with a lost pet. **TailFinder** is here to help make that happen, turning tearful moments into happy reunions!
